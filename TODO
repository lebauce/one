About the scale-in features:

-(Implement KVM's scaling methods)
-If we want VCPU hotpluging to be more useful, we must also take care of scaling the CPU share on the hypervisor
-Check/Separate variable used to monitor used memory and variable used to set new memory amount

-Check the aftermath of adding new states to the LCM
-Register VM changes to either the VM history or to new VM attributes
-Find a better way to inform the user in case of scale-in failure
-Extend polling/monitoring to get number of VCPUs
-When a scaling attempt fails, force a poll request
-Write tests
